# Levels of Testing: A Complete Approach to Quality Assurance

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the different levels of software testing, explaining that it is a crucial process to ensure a product's quality and functionality before its release. It details the four main levels of testing, starting from the smallest component to the system as a whole, to guarantee a bug-free product. The sequence of testing is also highlighted to ensure that the software is thoroughly checked at every stage of development.

- **Unit Testing:** Individual components or units of the software are tested to ensure they work as intended.
- **Integration Testing:** This level focuses on testing the interaction and data transfer between integrated units or modules.
- **System Testing:** The entire integrated system is tested to verify that it meets the specified business requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing:** The final level of testing where the software is tested by end-users to ensure it meets their expectations and is ready for deployment.
