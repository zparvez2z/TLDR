# The System Design Primer

The System Design Primer is a comprehensive open-source guide that helps engineers learn how to design large-scale systems. It covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental concepts like CAP theorem and load balancing to specific, real-world examples like designing a URL shortener or a news feed system. The repository also provides valuable resources for preparing for system design interviews, including a study guide, interview questions, and a collection of Anki flashcards for spaced repetition learning. It is a go-to resource for software engineers looking to build a strong foundation in system architecture and excel in technical interviews.
