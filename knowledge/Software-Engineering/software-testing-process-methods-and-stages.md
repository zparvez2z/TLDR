# Software Testing Process: A Guide to Methods and Stages

This article provides a comprehensive guide to the software testing process, emphasizing its role in improving product quality and reducing costs by detecting bugs early. It outlines the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC), which consists of several stages: requirements analysis, test planning, test design, execution, and maintenance. The guide also discusses various testing methods, including manual, automated, and exploratory, along with different types of testing like unit, integration, system, and user acceptance.

- The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) provides a systematic approach to ensure quality and efficient bug resolution.
- Key testing methods are manual, automated, and exploratory, each with distinct purposes and applications.
- Software testing is categorized into levels: unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.
- Best practices, such as starting testing early and performing it continuously, are essential for high-quality software.
- Non-functional testing, like performance and security testing, is critical for ensuring application reliability and security.
