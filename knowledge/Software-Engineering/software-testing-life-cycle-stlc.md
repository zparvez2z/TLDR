# Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC): Best Practices for Optimizing Testing

The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) provides a structured framework that organizes software testing into distinct stages, from requirement analysis to test closure. It operates as a specialized subset of the broader Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring that defects are identified and resolved early. The process enhances collaboration, aligns testing with project goals, and improves overall software reliability by emphasizing clear documentation and effective resource allocation.

- **STLC vs. SDLC**: STLC is a focused component within the larger SDLC, dedicated solely to the testing phases to validate software quality continuously.
- **Six Stages**: The STLC consists of six sequential phases: Requirement Analysis, Test Planning, Test Case Development, Test Environment Setup, Test Execution, and Test Closure.
- **Entry and Exit Criteria**: Each stage is governed by specific entry and exit criteria, ensuring a structured workflow and preventing incomplete testing.
- **Best Practices**: Effective STLC management is enhanced by choosing platforms that support Agile, integrating automation tools, simplifying reporting for cross-team visibility, and leveraging AI to support QA teams.
