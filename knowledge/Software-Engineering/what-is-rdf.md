# What is RDF?

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard designed for data interchange on the Web. It provides a common framework for expressing information in a machine-readable format, allowing data from different sources to be linked and integrated. RDF's data model is based on making statements about resources in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions, known as 'triples', which collectively form a directed, labeled graph.

*   **Graph-Based Data Model:** RDF represents information as a collection of triples (subject-predicate-object), which form a graph structure where subjects and objects are nodes and predicates are the connecting edges.
*   **Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs):** It uses URIs to give unique names to resources (subjects, predicates, and sometimes objects), enabling unambiguous data linking across the web.
*   **Semantic Web Foundation:** RDF is a fundamental technology for the Semantic Web, enabling the creation of a 'Web of Data' where information is interconnected and has well-defined meaning.
*   **Data Integration:** By providing a standard model, RDF facilitates the merging of data from disparate sources into a unified knowledge graph.
*   **Serialization Formats:** RDF data can be expressed in various syntaxes, such as RDF/XML, N-Triples, Turtle, and JSON-LD, to suit different use cases.
