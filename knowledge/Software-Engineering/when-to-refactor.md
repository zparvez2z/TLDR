# When to Refactor

Refactoring should be considered based on the 'Rule of Three': the third time a task is repeated, it's time to refactor. It is beneficial to refactor before adding a new feature, as it helps in understanding existing code and simplifies the addition of the new functionality. When fixing a bug, refactoring can help uncover errors by cleaning up the parts of the code where bugs are most likely to hide. Finally, a code review is presented as a crucial opportunity to clean up code before it is finalized.

*   **Rule of Three**: When you do something for the third time, it's a signal to start refactoring. [1]
*   **When Adding a Feature**: Refactoring before adding new features can make the process easier and helps in understanding unfamiliar code. [1]
*   **When Fixing a Bug**: Cleaning your code can make bugs easier to find, as they often exist in the most complex and untidy sections. [1]
*   **During a Code Review**: A code review can be the last chance to refactor and improve the code before it becomes public. [1]
