# Technical Debt

Technical debt is a metaphor for the consequences of prioritizing speed over writing clean code. [1] While this approach can accelerate development in the short term, it introduces complexities that will slow down future progress until the 'debt' is addressed, much like a financial loan accrues interest over time. [1] This debt accumulates for various reasons and can eventually make further development difficult or even impossible. [1]

*   **Business Pressure:** Rushing features to market can lead to unfinished code and workarounds. [1]
*   **Lack of Understanding:** Management may not grasp the long-term slowdown caused by technical debt, making it hard to allocate time for refactoring. [1]
*   **Poor Modularity:** Tightly coupled components mean changes in one area unexpectedly impact others, complicating development. [1]
*   **Absence of Tests:** A lack of immediate feedback from tests encourages risky workarounds and can lead to catastrophic failures in production. [1]
*   **Inadequate Documentation:** This slows the onboarding of new developers and creates risk if key personnel leave. [1]
*   **Delayed Refactoring:** As project requirements evolve, parts of the code become obsolete; the longer refactoring is postponed, the more dependent code will need to be reworked. [1]
