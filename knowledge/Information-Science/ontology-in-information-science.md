# Ontology (information science)

In information science, an ontology is a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. It provides a structured representation of knowledge by defining a set of concepts, categories, properties, and the relationships between them for a specific domain. This formal structure allows for reasoning about the entities within that domain and facilitates knowledge sharing and reuse across different systems and applications. Ontologies are a key component in fields like artificial intelligence, the Semantic Web, systems engineering, and biomedical informatics, serving as a foundation for modeling a domain of discourse.

*   **Definition:** An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a conceptualization, representing knowledge as a set of concepts and their relationships.
*   **Core Components:** Consists of individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes (properties), and relations that define a domain's structure.
*   **Purpose:** To enable a common understanding of a domain, facilitating knowledge sharing, data integration, and automated reasoning.
*   **Applications:** Crucial for the Semantic Web, artificial intelligence, systems engineering, and various scientific domains like bioinformatics.
*   **Languages:** Implemented using formal languages such as Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Resource Description Framework (RDF).
