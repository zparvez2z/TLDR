# What is RDF?

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard designed for modeling and exchanging data on the web. It represents information as a graph, using statements known as 'triples' which consist of a subject, a predicate, and an object. This simple yet powerful structure allows data from different sources to be linked together, forming a connected 'Web of Data' or knowledge graph. By using globally unique identifiers (URIs/IRIs) for resources, RDF facilitates data integration and enables sophisticated semantic queries that go beyond simple keyword matching.

* RDF is a graph-based data model for representing information as subject-predicate-object triples.
* It uses Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to give resources globally unique names, enabling data linking across the web.
* The model is flexible and schema-agnostic, making it easy to evolve data structures and integrate information from diverse sources.
* RDF forms the foundation of the Semantic Web and is crucial for building knowledge graphs.
* Data can be serialized in various formats, including Turtle, RDF/XML, and JSON-LD, and queried using the SPARQL query language.
