# Neural Architecture Search

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a technique for automating the design of artificial neural networks (ANNs), making it a key subfield of automated machine learning (AutoML). The process involves three primary components: a search space defining the possible architectures, a search strategy to explore this space, and a performance estimation strategy to evaluate the quality of different designs. NAS aims to discover novel network architectures that can outperform manually designed ones on specific tasks, such as image classification or object detection. This automation helps reduce the reliance on human expertise and extensive trial-and-error in deep learning model development.
