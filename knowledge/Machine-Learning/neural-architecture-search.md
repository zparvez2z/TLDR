# Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a technique for automating the design of artificial neural networks, a task that is typically a manual and time-consuming process for machine learning experts. NAS automates the process of finding the optimal network architecture for a given dataset and task, effectively treating the architecture design itself as a problem to be solved. The process involves three main components: a search space that defines the possible architectures, a search strategy that explores this space (often using methods like reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms), and a performance estimation strategy to evaluate the quality of a proposed architecture. By automating this design process, NAS can discover novel and highly efficient network architectures that outperform human-designed ones.
