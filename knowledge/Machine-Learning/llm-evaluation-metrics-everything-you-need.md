# LLM Evaluation Metrics: Everything You Need for LLM Evaluation

Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical step in building reliable and trustworthy AI applications. This guide explores the two primary categories of evaluation: traditional NLP metrics and modern LLM-based evaluation. While traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE offer quantitative, fast, and inexpensive analysis, they often fail to capture crucial aspects like semantic meaning, coherence, and factual accuracy. In contrast, LLM-based evaluation uses a powerful 'judge' LLM to assess outputs against nuanced, human-aligned criteria, providing a more comprehensive quality score despite challenges like cost and potential bias.

*   **Two Core Methods:** LLM evaluation is broadly divided into traditional NLP metrics and modern LLM-based evaluation.
*   **Traditional Metrics' Limitations:** Metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-score are objective but often inadequate for assessing the semantic quality and factual correctness of LLM-generated text.
*   **LLM-based Evaluation:** This approach uses a sophisticated LLM (e.g., GPT-4) as a 'judge' to score model outputs on customizable criteria like faithfulness, relevance, and coherence, offering a more scalable and human-like assessment.
*   **Key Evaluation Criteria:** Important metrics for LLM-based evaluation include faithfulness (factual consistency with context), answer relevancy, context relevance, and robustness against counterfactuals.
*   **Choosing the Right Metric:** The ideal evaluation strategy depends on the specific application, the required level of accuracy, and available resources, balancing the speed of traditional metrics with the depth of LLM-based analysis.
