# Evaluation is All You Need: Strategic Overclaiming of LLM Reasoning Capabilities Through Evaluation Design

This study reveals that benchmark results for reasoning-focused LLMs are highly sensitive to subtle variations in evaluation design, leading to significant performance fluctuations. Factors like random seed selection, dataset version, instruction placement, and answer bias can substantially alter scores, undermining the reliability and reproducibility of model comparisons. The authors argue that many claimed performance gains in open-source models are partially attributable to these favorable evaluation setups rather than genuine model improvements. To address this, they propose a more rigorous evaluation paradigm emphasizing transparency and stability to ensure fairer, more reliable assessments of LLM capabilities.

- **Evaluation Instability**: Minor, often overlooked changes in evaluation conditions—such as the choice of random seed, dataset version, or instruction position—can cause substantial fluctuations in benchmark scores.
- **Misleading Performance Claims**: Many claimed improvements in open-source models are difficult to reproduce and may stem from favorable evaluation configurations rather than true advancements in model capabilities.
- **Lack of Standardization**: The absence of standardized evaluation protocols leads to non-reproducible results, making it difficult to perform fair comparisons between different models.
- **Proposed Solution**: The authors advocate for a new evaluation paradigm based on two core principles: transparency (full disclosure of all evaluation settings) and stability (reporting statistically sound performance metrics like confidence intervals).
- **Call to Action**: The community is encouraged to adopt these rigorous practices to prevent overclaiming, ensure fair model comparisons, and foster the development of genuinely robust reasoning models.
